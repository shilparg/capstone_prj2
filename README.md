# capstone_prj2

Shilpa, here's a modular, low-cost capstone concept tailored to your strengths in embedded systems, cloud architecture, and governance‚Äîwith full coverage of IoT, ML/AI, security, and DevOps:

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Capstone Title: ‚ÄúSmart Environmental Monitoring & Prediction System on AWS‚Äù

### üéØ Objective
Design and deploy a scalable, secure, and cost-efficient system that collects real-time environmental data via IoT sensors, predicts pollution levels using ML models, and enforces DevOps best practices with security and compliance guardrails.

---

## üß© Architecture Overview

| Layer | Components | AWS Services |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **IoT Edge** | Sensors for temperature, humidity, CO‚ÇÇ | ESP32/Raspberry Pi, MQTT |
| **Ingestion** | Secure device communication | AWS IoT Core, AWS IoT Device Defender |
| **Processing** | Stream and batch pipelines | AWS Lambda, AWS Kinesis, AWS Glue |
| **Storage** | Raw + processed data | Amazon S3, DynamoDB |
| **ML/AI** | Pollution prediction | Amazon SageMaker (or Lambda + scikit-learn) |
| **Visualization** | Dashboards & alerts | Amazon QuickSight, SNS |
| **Security** | IAM, encryption, audit | IAM roles/policies, KMS, CloudTrail |
| **DevOps** | CI/CD, IaC, monitoring | CodePipeline, Terraform, CloudWatch |

---

## üí° Use Cases Covered

- **IoT**: Real-time sensor data ingestion and device health monitoring
- **ML/AI**: Predictive modeling for pollution levels using historical trends
- **Security**: Least privilege IAM, encrypted data, audit trails
- **DevOps**: GitHub-triggered CI/CD, Terraform-managed infrastructure, CloudWatch alerts

---

## üí∞ Cost Optimization Tips

- Use **Free Tier** services: Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudWatch
- Choose **Spot Instances** or **Graviton2** for SageMaker training
- Use **Athena** for serverless querying over S3
- Schedule **resource cleanup** via Lambda to avoid idle costs

---

## üìÅ Portfolio Deliverables

- ‚úÖ Terraform scripts for IoT + ML pipeline
- ‚úÖ Architecture diagrams (annotated for auditability)
- ‚úÖ README with use case mapping and cost breakdown
- ‚úÖ IAM policy snippets with security rationale
- ‚úÖ ML model notebook with explainability metrics
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline YAML + screenshots
